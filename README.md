# Hi there, I'm Flavius 👋
I love dogs and enjoy developing things!

## Some of the stuff I'm working on:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a game, RPGame Live, which I am developing in C#. There will be multiple parts to it, a main game built on likely Monogame, and a discord version that is mostly text based adventure in discord.
- ✍️ I'm also working on a blog about my adventures with programming, game dev, homelabs, hosting, and other things.
- 🌱 I previously wrote an almost fully working engine in Java for the game but then decided it would be better to use an actual framework or engine meant for game development.
