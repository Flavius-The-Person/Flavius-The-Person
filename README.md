# Hi there, I'm Flavius 👋

## I love dogs and enjoy developing things!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a game, RPGame Live, which I am developing in C#. Currently contemplating between trying to develop it with Blazor or in Monogame, Unity, or Godot. 
- 🌱 I previously wrote an almost fully working engine in Java for the game but then decided it would be better to use an actual framework or engine meant for game development.
