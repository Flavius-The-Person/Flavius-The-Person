### Hi there, I'm Chris - aka [Flavius] 👋

## I'm a dog lover and a developer.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a game, Legions Live, which I am developing on my own mini-engine I built in Java. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Javascript for when I decide to delve further into RPG Maker MV/Z (JS) or Monogame/Unity (C#) and move my current project onto one of these platforms.
