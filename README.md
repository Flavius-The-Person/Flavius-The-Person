# Hi there, I'm Flavius 👋

## I love dogs and enjoy developing things!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a game, RPGame Live, which I am developing in C#. There will be multiple parts to it, a main game built on likey Monogame, a discord version that is mostly text based adventure in discord, and maybe a website based version built in Blazor.
- 🌱 I previously wrote an almost fully working engine in Java for the game but then decided it would be better to use an actual framework or engine meant for game development.
